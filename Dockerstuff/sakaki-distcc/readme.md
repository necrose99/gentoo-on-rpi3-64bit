workable example of a crossdev docker distcc for host. 
If you have a beffy server , or 10 core i7 etc or even a seldome used... wich can run docker as a container 
minimizes risks , anyhow this will create a crossdev/crossbuilder , workable example.. 

you can add packages like GOX if you like (Crossbuilds in go-lang) rust etc.. 

Minimal Gentoo stage 3 etc. in dockerhub you can add gentoo-portage to have /usr/portage... etc

Use and Abuse as a template..
